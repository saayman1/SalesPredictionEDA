# SalesPredictionAnalysis
A project done during the MIT Applied Data Science Program under Great Learning. 
Problem Statement:
SuperKart is an organization that owns a chain of supermarkets and food marts providing a wide range of products. 
They want to predict the future sales revenue of its different outlets so that they can strategize their sales operation across different tier cities and plan their inventory accordingly. 
To achieve this purpose, SuperKart has hired a data science firm, shared the sales records of its various outlets for the previous quarter, and asked the firm to come up with a suitable model to predict the total sales of the stores for the upcoming quarter.
We are tasked with first doing an exploratory data analysis to see what assumptions we can draw from the data
